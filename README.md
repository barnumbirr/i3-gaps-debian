# i3-gaps-debian

This repository contains the source to build a Debian package for [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3).

## Usage

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed locally, just run the following:

```bash
$ ./build.sh
```
By default this will build i3-gaps 4.20 on Debian Bullseye.

If you want to customize the build at runtime, use the following:

```bash
$ ./build.sh -i debian:unstable-slim -v 4.16.1
```
Don't forget to update `debian/changelog` so your package is generated with the correct version.

## Release

To publish a new package version to Github, follow these steps:
  * update the `VERSION` variable in `build.sh`
  * add a new entry in `debian/changelog`
  * create a new tag with the Debian package version
